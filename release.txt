Support architecture input

This release introduces support for architecture input for `setup-go` action #253. It also adds support for arm32 architecture for self-hosted runners. If architecture is not provided action will use default runner architecture.
Example of usage:

 ```yml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- uses: actions/setup-go@v3
  with:
    go-version: '1.16'
    architecture: arm
```

This release also provides fix for issue #241. #250 adds support for using explicit filename for Windows which is necessary to satisfy Expand-Archive's requirement on .zip extension.
